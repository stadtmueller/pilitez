Turn your Raspberry Pi into a 8-channel lighting console/colour organ with an additional selfmade circuit.

On almost every major party these systems accompany the music with their light. This version uses a Raspberry Pi and an additional circuit that has to be build up either with LED's or with light bulbs in a bigger circuit.

The required software contains functions to switch the pins on or off in certain patterns and orders.
